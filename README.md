Level-Based Block Progression: Introduces difficulty through levels:
- Level 1: Starts with basic blocks for easier matching.
- Higher Levels: Increase difficulty with patterned blocks (more points) for strategic play.

Shiny Block Powerup: A special block that:
- Offers strategic advantage by destroying its entire row.
