# Match3

This is a coursework project from Harvard University`s CS50G.

# Implemented Features:

Enhanced Scoring: Scoring a match adds 1 second per tile matched to the game timer, extending playtime for skilled players.

Level Progression:
- Level 1: Introduces a beginner-friendly experience with basic, unpatterned blocks for easier matching.
- Higher Levels: Gradually increases difficulty by introducing blocks with patterns (triangle, cross, etc.) that award bonus points for a greater challenge.

Shiny Block Powerup: Implemented special shiny blocks that:
- Offer a strategic advantage by destroying an entire row when matched.
- Reward players with additional points for each block cleared in the destroyed row.

Strategic Swapping: Ensures only swaps that result in a match are allowed. If no valid matches exist, the board resets, encouraging strategic planning.

Intuitive Controls: Implemented user-friendly mouse controls for block swapping, allowing players to easily interact with the game.
